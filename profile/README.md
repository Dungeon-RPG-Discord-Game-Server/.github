# Discord RPG - Cloud Native Game Server System

This is a **cloud-native, modular turn-based RPG server system**  
built for Discord using **.NET 8**, **Azure**, and modern backend practices.

---

## How to Play

1. **Invite the Bot**  
   Use the invitation link to add the bot to your Discord server or personal account. -> **[Invite the RPG Bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1345637408691064843)**  

2. **Start the Game**  
   Type the `/start` slash command to receive a **DM** from the bot and begin your adventure.  
   ðŸ”¹ *You can use slash commands in any server where the bot exists or directly in App Messages.*

3. **Play in Direct Messages**  
   All gameplay takes place in DMs. Use commands like `!help` to view available actions.

4. **Access Main Menu**  
   Use `!menu` anytime during gameplay to return to the **main game menu**.

5. **Save Your Progress**  
   Use the `!save` command to **store your current game state** on the server.

---

The system is split into two microservices:

1. `DiscordMessageReceiver` â€“ Handles Discord bot commands & user input
2. `GameStateService` â€“ Stores and processes game logic, combat, and state

All communication between services is done via **HTTP + API Key authentication**  
with **in-memory caching**, **Key Vault integration**, and **full observability** via **OpenTelemetry**.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|------|------|
| **Language** | .NET 8 (C#) |
| **Bot Framework** | Discord.NET |
| **HTTP Communication** | HttpClient |
| **Cloud Platform** | Azure Container Apps |
| **Database** | Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL) |
| **Secrets Management** | Azure Key Vault |
| **Authentication** | API Key + In-Memory Cache |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions |
| **Observability** | OpenTelemetry (Tracing & Logging) |

---

## Authentication System

### Admin Flow (Key Issuance)

![System Diagram](/profile/api_key_discord.png)

- Discord service pulls a **permanent admin key** from Azure Key Vault
- This is used only to request short-lived **game API keys**
- These are stored in **in-memory cache** and refreshed on expiration

### Game API Flow

![System Diagram](/profile/api_key_game.drawio.png)

- Incoming HTTP requests to game service are authenticated via API Key header
- Middleware checks:
  - Is key in local memory cache?
  - If not â†’ Pull from Key Vault and cache it
  - If invalid or expired â†’ Return `403 Forbidden`

---

##  Features

- Full text-based RPG playable through **Discord**
- Commands support both **prefix (`!menu`, `!help`)** and **slash commands (`/start`)**
- Game session & state are persisted in **Cosmos DB**, with caching in memory
- Combat, movement, map traversal and more
- Rich **embedded messages** with status, stats, monsters, rewards
- Minimal latency via **cache-first reads**, writes only on save

---

## Deployment

Both services are deployed independently as containerized applications:

### DiscordMessageReceiver

- Deployed as Azure Container App
- Uses `minReplicas: 1` to remain Always On
- Receives Discord Gateway messages (WebSocket)

### GameStateService

- Stateless service hosted on Azure
- Only persists data to Cosmos DB
- Optimized for fast read/write performance

### CI/CD via GitHub Actions

- Build â†’ Docker Image â†’ Push to Azure Container Registry
- No auto-deploy; manual `az containerapp update` used for rollout

---

## Troubleshooting Summary

| Problem | Resolution |
|--------|------------|
| Azure Container App auto shutdown | Set `minReplicas: 1` to keep Discord service alive |
| Key Vault latency (200â€“300ms) | Cached all secrets in memory â†’ 1â€“2ms |
| Secure multi-service API auth | Implemented full API Key flow w/ cache & Key Vault |
| Cosmos DB read overhead | Used in-memory cache for gameplay state, wrote only on save |

---

## Sample Commands

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `!menu` | Begin new game or continue saved state |
| `!save` | Save current progress |
| `/start` | Slash command to start the adventure (sends DM) |

 All gameplay takes place in **DMs** for a private RPG experience.

## Design Philosophy

- Fast: Optimized performance using memory-first reads
- Secure: API Key, secrets isolation via Key Vault
- Scalable: Stateless containers & modular architecture
- Simple: Only use necessary infra, no overengineering
- Transparent: Every interaction is traceable via OpenTelemetry
